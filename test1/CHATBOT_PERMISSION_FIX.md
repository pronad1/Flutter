# 🔧 Firebase Permission Fix

## Problem
The chatbot was getting `[cloud_firestore/permission-denied]` error when trying to fetch statistics.

## Root Cause
Firestore security rules only allow:
- ✅ `items` collection: Public read access
- ✅ `publicProfiles` collection: Public read access  
- ❌ `users` collection: Only owner/admin can read (PRIVATE)

The chatbot was trying to read the `users` collection, which is blocked by security rules.

## Solution Applied

### Changed Data Source:
**Before:**
```dart
// ❌ Trying to read private 'users' collection
final usersSnapshot = await _firestore.collection('users').get();
```

**After:**
```dart
// ✅ Reading public 'publicProfiles' collection
final profilesSnapshot = await _firestore.collection('publicProfiles').get();
```

### Statistics Now Available:

1. **User Count** - Counts documents in `publicProfiles` (public collection)
2. **Active Donors** - Counts unique `ownerId` values from `items` collection
3. **Item Statistics** - Full access to `items` collection (categories, availability, etc.)
4. **Recent Posts** - Shows last 5 items with names and dates

## What Works Now

### ✅ Working Queries:

**"How many users here?"**
```
