# ✅ Auto-Sync Profile Solution

## 🎯 Problem Identified

**Symptom:**
- Viewing **your own profile** (Prosenjit Mondol): Shows photo, bio, "Send Email" button ✅
- Viewing **other users' profiles** (Saikat Mondol): Shows only default avatar, no bio, no email button ❌

**Root Cause:**
- Profile data exists in `users` collection (private - only owner can read)
- Profile data NOT synced to `publicProfiles` collection (public - anyone can read)
- When you view your own profile: App reads from `users` (allowed)
- When you view others' profiles: App can't read their `users` (Firestore rules block it)

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### **Auto-Sync on Profile View**

Added automatic sync that triggers when a user views **their own profile**:

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _autoSyncProfile(); // Auto-sync when opening profile
}

Future<void> _autoSyncProfile() async {
  // Only sync if viewing OWN profile
  if (currentUser.uid != widget.userId) return;
  
  // Read from users collection (private)
  final userData = await users.doc(userId).get();
  
  // Update publicProfiles (public)
  await publicProfiles.doc(userId).set({
    'name': userData['name'],
    'bio': userData['bio'],
    'photoUrl': userData['photoUrl'],
    'email': userData['email'],
  }, merge: true);
}
```

## 📱 How It Works

### **Scenario 1: User Views Own Profile**

```
User opens their own profile
  ↓
Auto-sync triggers
  ↓
Reads users/{uid} (private) ✅ Allowed (owner)
  ↓
Writes to publicProfiles/{uid} (public) ✅ Allowed (owner can create/update own)
  ↓
✅ Profile now visible to EVERYONE!
```

### **Scenario 2: User Views Someone Else's Profile**

```
User opens another user's profile
  ↓
Auto-sync skips (not viewing own profile)
  ↓
Reads publicProfiles/{uid} (public) ✅ Allowed (public read)
  ↓
If data exists: Shows photo, bio, email button ✅
If data missing: Shows default avatar, "No bio provided"
```

## 🚀 Testing Instructions

### **Step 1: Sync Saikat Mondol's Profile**

1. **Log in as Saikat Mondol**
2. **Navigate to his profile** (any way - home, dashboard, etc.)
3. **Wait 2-3 seconds** (auto-sync runs automatically)
4. **Console shows:** `✅ Auto-synced profile data to publicProfiles/...`
5. **✅ Done!** His profile is now synced

### **Step 2: View from Another Account**

1. **Log out and log in as different user** (e.g., Prosenjit)
2. **Navigate to Saikat Mondol's profile**
3. **Should now see:**
   - ✅ Profile photo
   - ✅ Bio text
   - ✅ "Send Email" button
   - ✅ Rating stars

### **Step 3: Sync All Users**

**Each donor needs to:**
1. Log in to their account
2. View their own profile once
3. Auto-sync runs automatically
4. ✅ Profile visible to everyone!

## 📊 Expected Results

### **Before Sync (Current State):**

| User | Viewing Own Profile | Others Viewing Profile |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Prosenjit | ✅ Photo, bio, email | ✅ Photo, bio, email (already synced) |
| Saikat | ✅ Photo, bio, email | ❌ Default avatar, no bio, no email |

### **After Sync (Saikat views his profile once):**

| User | Viewing Own Profile | Others Viewing Profile |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Prosenjit | ✅ Photo, bio, email | ✅ Photo, bio, email |
| Saikat | ✅ Photo, bio, email | ✅ Photo, bio, email (NOW SYNCED!) |

---

## 🔍 Console Debugging

### **When viewing own profile:**
```
✅ Auto-synced profile data to publicProfiles/abc123
✅ Successfully read publicProfiles/abc123
```

### **When creating new publicProfiles:**
```
✅ Auto-created publicProfiles/abc123 from users data
```

### **When data already synced:**
```
(No message - sync skipped, data already complete)
```

---

## 💡 Alternative: Manual Sync Button

If users don't view their own profile, you can add a manual sync option:

### **In Profile Screen (Edit Profile):**

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    // Manually sync profile
    await _syncToPublicProfiles();
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(content: Text('Profile synced! Now visible to everyone.')),
    );
  },
  child: Text('Make Profile Public'),
)
```

## 🎯 Summary

### **What Changed:**
- ✅ Added `_autoSyncProfile()` method
- ✅ Calls automatically in `initState()`
- ✅ Only runs when viewing OWN profile
- ✅ Syncs name, bio, photo, email to publicProfiles
- ✅ Creates publicProfiles if doesn't exist
- ✅ Updates publicProfiles if fields are empty

### **User Action Required:**
- **Each donor** must view their own profile **once**
- Auto-sync runs automatically
- Profile then visible to everyone!

### **For Saikat Mondol:**
1. Log in as Saikat
2. Navigate to any donor profile (or products)
3. Click on his own name/product
4. ✅ Auto-sync runs
5. ✅ Profile now visible to all users!

## 🔒 Security Note

**This is safe because:**
- ✅ Only the profile owner can trigger sync (checked: `currentUser.uid == widget.userId`)
- ✅ Only reads from their own `users` document (Firestore rules allow)
- ✅ Only writes to their own `publicProfiles` (Firestore rules allow)
- ✅ No data leakage (only public-safe fields: name, bio, photo, email)

---

**Hot reload (`R`) and test!** Ask each donor to view their own profile once to sync! 🚀
