# ✅ DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

## Current Status
- ✅ Code is ready (all files updated)
- ❌ **Firestore rules NOT deployed** ← YOU MUST DO THIS!
- ❌ **publicProfiles documents may not exist** ← Need to create them

---

## Step-by-Step Fix (Do in Order!)

### ☐ Step 1: Deploy Firestore Rules (5 minutes)

1. Open: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to: **Build** → **Firestore Database** → **Rules** tab
4. **Copy-paste** the rules from `QUICK_FIX.md` (entire rules block)
5. Click **Publish** button
6. ✅ Verify you see: "Rules published successfully"

**How to verify**: In Rules tab, you should see:
```
match /publicProfiles/{userId} {
  allow read: if true;
```

---

### ☐ Step 2A: Test with NEW User (Recommended - Fastest)

```powershell
# 1. Run app
flutter run

# 2. Click "Sign Up" and create a new test account
#    - Name: "Test Donor"
#    - Email: testdonor@example.com
#    - Password: test1234

# 3. This automatically creates publicProfiles/{uid}

# 4. Have this user donate a product (create an item)

# 5. Log out, log in as a different user

# 6. Tap that product → Should show donor profile! ✅
```

**OR**

### ☐ Step 2B: Fix Existing User Profile

```powershell
# 1. Run app
flutter run

# 2. Log in as existing user

# 3. Go to "Edit Profile"

# 4. Make ANY change (change name, bio, or upload photo)

# 5. Click "Save Changes"

# 6. This creates/updates publicProfiles/{uid}

# 7. Now when others tap your products, they see your profile! ✅
```

---

### ☐ Step 3: Verify It Works

1. Run app: `flutter run`
2. Watch the console for these messages:
   ```
   ✅ Successfully read publicProfiles/abc123...
   ```
3. Tap any product
4. You should see:
   - ✅ Donor name, photo, bio
   - ✅ Reviews section
   - ✅ Email button
   - ✅ Submit review form

**If you still see "Donor profile (limited)"**:
- Check console for: `⚠️ publicProfiles/... does not exist`
- This means: Do Step 2 (create the publicProfiles document)

**If you see permission error**:
- Check console for: `❌ Error reading publicProfiles/...`
- This means: Do Step 1 (deploy rules)

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: "I deployed the rules but it still doesn't work"
**Problem**: publicProfiles document doesn't exist for that user
**Fix**: Do Step 2 (update profile or create new user)

### ❌ Mistake 2: "I updated my profile but still see limited view"
**Problem**: Rules not deployed
**Fix**: Do Step 1 (deploy rules in Firebase Console)

### ❌ Mistake 3: "I did both but still not working"
**Problem**: Testing with a product whose owner hasn't updated their profile yet
**Fix**: Use Step 2A (create NEW test user, donate item, test with that)

## 📱 Quick Test Script

```powershell
# Terminal 1: Run app
cd 'd:\Languages\Fllutter\test1'
flutter run

# Then in the app:
# 1. Sign up new user: "Alice" (alice@test.com, pass123)
# 2. Alice creates a donation item
# 3. Log out
# 4. Sign up another user: "Bob" (bob@test.com, pass123)
# 5. Bob taps Alice's product
# 6. ✅ Should see Alice's profile with reviews!
```

---

## 🔍 Debug Console Output

After deploying rules and updating profile, you should see:
```
✅ Successfully read publicProfiles/xyz789...
```

If you see:
```
⚠️ publicProfiles/xyz789 does not exist
```
→ That user needs to update their profile (Step 2)

If you see:
```
❌ Error reading publicProfiles/xyz789: permission-denied
```
→ Rules not deployed correctly (Step 1)

---

## ✨ Success Criteria

You know it's working when:
- ✅ Tap product → See full donor profile (not "limited")
- ✅ Can submit reviews
- ✅ Can see existing reviews
- ✅ Email button appears (if donor has email)
- ✅ Console shows: "Successfully read publicProfiles/..."
