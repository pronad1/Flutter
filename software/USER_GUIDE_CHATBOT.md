## Tips for Best Experience

### Positioning Tips:
- **Bottom-right**: Default position (above navigation bar)
- **Bottom-left**: Good for left-handed users
- **Top corners**: Keeps it out of the way
- **Anywhere**: It's your choice!

### Button Won't Overlap:
- Automatically stays within screen bounds
- Won't go off-screen
- Smooth dragging animation

### Using the Assistant:
1. **Tap** (don't hold) to open the chat
2. Ask questions like:
   - "How do I post an item?"
   - "How does the rating system work?"
   - "I need technical support"
3. Use quick action buttons for common questions
4. Close and reopen anytime - it starts fresh!
